## About this repository

## Challenge
In this exercise it was required to setup a project with Babel and Webpack in order to use the latest JS syntax and still keep the compatibility between the browsers. 

In order to create the `dist/bundle.js`:
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the build process: `npm run build`
